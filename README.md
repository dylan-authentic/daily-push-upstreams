# Daily Push-Upstreams

In an effort to increase and strengthen my development skills, I've started this project as a way to track and share daily coding challenges for myself. The idea is to increase learning, practice, and repetition by working on various programs, algorithms, languages, libraries, and other projects of interest every day.

> In this repo, you'll find sub-directories for each day of coding. Within those sub-directories, you'll find a notes document containing any key learnings I've gained from that days practice. In addition, you'll find code files named according to the type of program or challenge they refer to.
